- 👋 Hi, I’m @KairaKay
- 👀 I’m interested in refreshing my outdated skills and learning new ones....
- 🌱 I’m currently re training my brain to remember how to code....
- 💞️ I’m took programming in college but as with most things if you don't excercise the skill your brain tends to forget how to use it. So I'm working on that.
 ...Right now I'm trying to root an old phone and it's stumping me. Quite frankly it's embarrassing me. Lol. I can't figure out what's failing it. 🤷
- 📫 How to reach me kimmydavis52389@gmail.com and my text now is 8325291459 thanks so much for having me and I hope all your days are blessed. Sincerely,
Just an old bird from south Texas lol. It's me, Kaira K.D.😁...
